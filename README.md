# Greenedge Contest: Energy Aware Image Classification

In this competition, we are calling on participants to develop a model that excels in both energy efficiency and accuracy when classifying the TinyImageNet test set. Specifically, the participants will tackle a multi-class classification problem on this dataset, focusing on optimizing the energy-accuracy trade-off during the inference phase. We’re eager to see innovative approaches that effectively balance minimizing the average energy consumption with delivering accurate results.

### Who Can Participate?

BS, MS level and PhD students are invited to participate in the challenge. The submitted projects will undergo an evaluation by a team of scientists from the GREENEDGE consortium. The winners will be invited to participate in the final GREENEDGE workshop where they will present their work and will receive a prize. The final workshop will be co-located with an international conference and will take place around September 2024 (detailed instructions will follow). You can participate via [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yRJeGClPCQ2gYcFEnlYAFMhkZ9-wMnOJwHa8VXHpn6M/).
